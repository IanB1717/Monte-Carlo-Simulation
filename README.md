# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
This is the code that I created to do a monte carlo simulation on the Irish Presidential election 2018 . I found the probability that the three candidates from the TV series Dragons Den would all come in the last three places of the election but only the Dragons could be in the last three places but any dragon could occupy any position in the last three places. 

It would be quiet easy to automate this code by using one method which reads in which candidates would be in first second and third in the election and the running it through a for a loop in the main method and then getting the average of the outputs after the for loop has run.
